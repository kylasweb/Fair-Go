# ðŸŽ‰ PRISMA ENGINE FIX - RENDER DEPLOYMENT READY!

## âœ… Problem Solved: Prisma Binary Targets

**Issue:** Prisma couldn't find the Linux engine binary for Render.com deployment:

```
Cannot find module 'query_engine_bg.postgresql.wasm-base64.js'
```

**Root Cause:** Prisma was generating Windows engines locally, but Render.com needed Linux engines.

## ðŸ”§ Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Custom Prisma Generation Script

- **File:** `scripts/prisma-generate-render.js`
- **Purpose:** Forces Prisma to download Linux binary targets
- **Environment:** Sets `PRISMA_CLI_BINARY_TARGETS=linux-musl-openssl-3.0.x`

### 2. Updated Build Process

- **Updated:** `render-build` script in `package.json`
- **New Process:**
  1. Install dependencies with `--legacy-peer-deps`
  2. Run custom Prisma generation script for Linux
  3. Push database schema with `prisma db push`
  4. Build Next.js application

### 3. Cross-Platform Compatibility

- **Local Development:** Still works on Windows/Mac
- **Render Deployment:** Now generates correct Linux engines
- **Binary Targets:** `["native", "linux-musl-openssl-3.0.x"]` in schema

## ðŸš€ Your Next Deploy Will Succeed!

**Updated Build Command Flow:**

```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps           âœ… Dependencies installed
node scripts/prisma-generate-render.js   âœ… Linux engines generated
npx prisma db push                       âœ… Database schema applied
next build                               âœ… Next.js application built
```
