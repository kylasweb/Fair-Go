# Fair-Go Taxi Booking Platform - Project Summary

## 1. Conversation Overview

### Primary Objectives

- **User Request 1**: "Full dark mode to be in Black Neomorphism design style, not just two or three cards"
- **User Request 2**: "What user facing and admin facing pages are missing or is not part of the codebase but you think should be present"

### Session Context

Progressive enhancement from implementing comprehensive black neomorphism theming → conducting thorough codebase analysis for missing functionality

### User Intent Evolution

Moved from design system completion to strategic platform assessment and gap identification

## 2. Technical Foundation

### Black Neomorphism System

- **Color Palette**: Pure black (#0f0f0f) backgrounds with enhanced shadow utilities

### Component Architecture

- **NeoCard System**: 4 variants (flat, raised, inset, pressed) for different UI states
- **NeoButton System**: 4 variants matching card system for consistent interaction design
- **Integration**: Applied across all major pages and components

### Tailwind Configuration

- **Extended Colors**: neo-dark: '#0f0f0f', shadow-dark: '#000000'
- **Enhanced Utilities**: 'neo-dark-raised', 'neo-dark-inset' shadows
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach maintained across all neomorphism effects
